# myFlix React movie_api-client.

This is the first client-side version for the API I built as part of my CareerFoundry Web Development curriculum and it is built using React.

The second version was built using Angular and lives [here](https://filip-sazdov.github.io/myFlix-Angular-client/welcome) and the repo for it is [here](https://github.com/Filip-Sazdov/myFlix-Angular-client).
